			<p class="lead">Thank you for your participation in our study!  Your anonymous data makes an
				important contribution to our understanding of how people make decisions. </p>

				<p>In this study, we are interested in understanding how people make decisions about things in front of them while trying to remember additional information that helps them make the decision. For example, if you drive and see a red light, usually that means to stop and wait. But in many states you can turn right on red, so you have to remember the law in your particular 
				state to act appropriately. Similarly, when you see a green light, you might have to pause and wait if trying to turn left, but you can simply continue if you want to go straight. In that situation, you must remember your previous intention 
				to act appropriately at the green light. In both cases, you have to combine information from memory with what is in front of you 
				to make a decision.
				</p>

				<p>This study is designed as a simplified version of such decisions: the first stimulus you saw was designed to create a rule that you have to remember in order to press the correct button for the second stimulus. We are interested in how the timing and accuracy of that decision change depending on how frequently the different stimulus combinations appear.
				</p>

				<p>Such decisions are not only common in our daily life, but are also ones impaired in schizophrenia, anxiety, aging, and other circumstances. By understanding how they work, we might be able to help people with these problems compensate for their disorder.
				</p>

				<p>If you have any questions about this research, you may contact the
					principal investigator at <a href="mailto:lositsky.mturk@gmail.com">lositsky.mturk@gmail.com</a>.</p>
