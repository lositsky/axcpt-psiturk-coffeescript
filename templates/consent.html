                    <h2>TITLE OF RESEARCH: Dynamics of Context Updating in Prefrontal Cortex</h2>
                    <p>INVESTIGATOR: Jonathan Cohen, Leigh Nystrom, Olga Lositsky, Abigail Novick</p>
<p>
    The following informed consent is required by Princeton University for any person involved in a research study conducted by investigators at the University.  This study has been approved by the University's Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects.
</p>
You have:<p>
<ol>
    <li>  Provided me with a detailed explanation of the procedures to be followed in the project, including an identification of those which are experimental.<br />
<blockquote>
        I understand that I will be asked to perform a task which involves stimuli appearing on a computer screen, to which I will be asked to respond by pressing a button. At times, the task will require me to remember and recognize stimuli, while at other times I will need to remember which stimulus corresponds to which rule of the game. I will be rewarded a small sum for each trial I perform correctly, and may earn a total of 2$ for my performance, in addition to a baseline rate of 3$/hour.</blockquote>
</li>
    <li>  Answered any questions that I have regarding the study.
</li>
</ol></p>
